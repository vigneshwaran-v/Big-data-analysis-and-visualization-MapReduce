Cambridge Analytica up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a conference call with reporters that Facebook had not seen any meaningful impact on usage or ad sales since the scandal although he added it's not good if people are unhappy with the company Shares rose more than 3 percent after the bell Zuckerberg told reporters that he accepted blame for the data leak which has angered users advertisers and lawmakers while also saying he was still the right person to head the company he founded When you're building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world there are going to be things that you mess up Zuckerberg said adding that the important thing was to learn from mistakes He said he was not aware of any discussions on the Facebook board about him stepping down although directors would face a challenge if they wanted to oust him because Zuckerberg is the controlling shareholder He said he had not fired anyone over the scandal and did not plan to I'm not looking to throw anyone else under the bus for mistakes that we made here he said Facebook first acknowledged last month that personal information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica Zuckerberg will testify about the matter next Tuesday and Wednesday during two US congressional hearings

received no more than 30 million records from a researcher it hired to collect data about people on Facebook Zuckerberg on the call with reporters said Facebook should have done more to audit and oversee thirdparty app developers like the one that Cambridge Analytica hired in 2014 Knowing what I know today clearly we should have done more he said Going forward he said Facebook was taking steps to restrict which personal data is available to thirdparty app developers and he said it might take two more years to fix Facebook's problems We're broadening our view of our responsibility Zuckerberg said Most of the up to 87 million people whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica were in the United States Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer wrote in a blog post Graphic Shares in Facebook closed down 06 percent on Wednesday to 15510 They have tumbled more than 16 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke The previous estimate of more than 50 million Facebook users affected by the data leak came from two newspapers the New York Times and London's Observer based on their investigations of Cambridge Analytica Zuckerberg said Facebook came to the higher estimate by looking at the number of people who had downloaded a personality quiz app created by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan or about 270000 people and then adding in the number of friends they had Cambridge Analytica has said that it engaged Kogan in good faith to collect Facebook data in a manner similar to how other thirdparty app developers have harvested personal information The scandal

Dalgleish and Cynthia Osterman Cambridge Analytica the political data firm with ties to President Trumps 2016 campaign suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix on Tuesday amid the furor over the access it gained to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users The decision came after a television broadcast in which Mr Nix was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections The suspension represented a new low point for the fortunes of Cambridge Analytica and for Mr Nix who spent much of the past year making bold claims about the role his outfit played in the election of Mr Trump The company founded by Stephen K Bannon and Robert Mercer a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least 15 million into it offered tools that it claimed could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior Socalled psychographic modeling techniques which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook underpinned Cambridge Analyticas work for the Trump campaign in 2016 Mr Nix once called the practice our secret sauce though some have questioned its effectiveness But in recent days the firm has found itself under increased scrutiny from lawmakers regulators and prosecutors in the United States and Britain following reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the Facebook data and that it still had a copy of the information The reports quickly put Mr Nix in the cross hairs of a parliamentary committee investigating fake news and Russian interference in Britains referendum to exit the European Union Earlier this month he told the committee that Cambridge Analytica had never obtained or used Facebook data  a statement that the firm itself has contradicted in recent days But it was Mondays broadcast by Channel 4 News in Britain that appeared to push the board of Cambridge Analytica to move against Mr Nix Channel 4 spent months investigating the company and sent a reporter to pose as a prospective client from Sri Lanka secretly filming the encounters with Mr Nix The most damning footage was captured in January when Mr Nix sitting in a hotel bar in London suggested the firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe We have a long history of working behind the scenes Mr Nix said Inside Cambridge Analytica Mr Nix the scion of a wealthy family who attended Eton College the exclusive secondary school had a reputation for lashing out at staff members and for aggressively pursuing deals Christopher Wylie a data expert who worked at the firm in 2013 and 2014 and helped develop its voterprofiling technology said in a recent interview that he kept memberships at a number of exclusive strip clubs near Pall Mall in London at the insistence of Mr Nix who often entertained clients from African and Caribbean countries there Why would I have these memberships said Mr Wylie who is gay I didnt want them Channel 4 followed up Tuesday with a second part of its investigation that focused mainly on Mr Nixs claims that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in the election of Mr Trump  a claim that many inside the Trump campaign have disputed The Channel 4 report also included allegations first reported by The Times this past weekend that Cambridge Analyticas use of foreigners to work on election campaigns in the United States could have violated American election laws The Times did not work with Channel 4 Announcing its chief executives suspension Cambridge Analytica said in a statement that in the view of the board Mr Nixs recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation The company said it had asked Alexander Tayler its chief data officer to serve as its acting chief executive Mr Tayler trained as a chemical engineer and joined Cambridge Analytica in 2014 as its lead data scientist according to his LinkedIn profile At the same time the company said it was initiating an independent investigation of Mr Nixs comments and the allegations facing the firm The company said it had hired a lawyer Julian Malins to lead this investigation the findings of which the board will share publicly in due course It added The board will be monitoring the situation closely working closely with Dr Tayler to ensure that Cambridge Analytica in all of its operations represents the firms values and delivers the highestquality service to its clients It was not immediately clear what impact Mr Nixs resignation would have on the SCL Group the parent company of Cambridge Analytica The companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and their operations are deeply intertwined Mr Nix for instance holds dual appointments at the two companies Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family but it is effectively a shell  it holds intellectual property rights to its psychographic modeling tools yet its clients are served by the staff at Londonbased SCL and overseen by Mr Nix who is a British citizen Neither the Mercer family nor Mr Bannon has publicly commented since the reports in the Times and The Observer Facebook too has sought to avoid the spotlight but also found itself under a similarly unwelcome glare In the United States the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into whether Facebook violated an agreement with the agency on data privacy In addition Eric T Schneiderman the attorney general of New York said the state was joining Massachusetts in an investigation into whether the company failed to protect the privacy of users in those states Their attorneys general have demanded that Facebook hand over information about its interactions with Cambridge Analytica Consumers have a right to know how their information is used  and companies like Facebook have a fundamental responsibility to protect their users personal information Mr Schneiderman said In Britain Damian Collins the chairman of the Digital Culture Media and Sport Select Committee of the House of Commons which is running the inquiry into fake news called on Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief executive to give evidence to Parliament In a letter Mr Collins said that previous answers from Facebook officials about the misuse of data had been misleading It is now time to hear from a senior Facebook executive with the sufficient authority to give an accurate account of this catastrophic failure of process

Gadsby a major new talent An advertising trade group that gave an award to Cambridge Analytica last year for its big data work during the 2016 presidential election is now urging marketers to reconsider the ethics of how consumer information is collected and used The trade group the Advertising Research Foundation said it was waiting for more information before formally rescinding the award given to Cambridge Analytica the British political consulting firm that was recently reported to have improperly harvested the data of 50 million Facebook users The revelations have brought intense criticism of Facebook which is facing inquiries from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic around how it handles user information and have many people taking a closer look at the role of data in online advertising Weve tended to assume that because you can do something you should Scott McDonald chief executive of the ad group said in an interview on Tuesday He added that advertisers had been more concerned with the accuracy and validity of data they received from technology companies than with asking whether they should be collecting that data and using it to target consumers in the first place Mr McDonald addressed the Cambridge Analytica situation and the need for new guidelines during a speech on Wednesday morning at the groups annual convention in New York Things were much different last year when Cambridge Analytica won a gold prize at the foundations David Ogilvy Awards which have been given annually since 1994 The firm was honored for its work for the Trump campaign in which it identified and advertised to undecided voters The selection made by a jury of ad industry leaders was very controversial because of the nature of the campaign Mr McDonald said But the ad group viewed itself as Switzerland he said and was simply conducting a scientific evaluation of the quality of work Nobody had any idea the data might have been pilfered he said Mr McDonald said he planned to potentially poll the jury again and see if the accusations are sustained before officially stripping Cambridge Analytica of the award The existence of the award highlights the enthusiasm with which marketers have approached the reams of consumer data generated by digital devices and their belief that people are happy to share whatever information technology may be collecting from them The Advertising Research Foundation which acknowledged that the United States may adopt new regulations on how consumer data is collected said it planned to work with other industry groups to form new guidelines for collecting and protecting that information Mr McDonald said advertising had gone too far in viewing consumers as prey noting that even the industrys vocabulary had become militarylike We talk about ad campaigns consumers we target We talk about subway takeovers popups he said These are fairly aggressive and I dont think we even think about it  theyre just embedded in the metaphors of advertising Our report that a political firm hired by the Trump campaign acquired access to private data on millions of Facebook users has sparked new questions about how the social media giant protects user information Cambridge Analytica a political data firm hired by President Trumps 2016 election campaign gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer the wealthy Republican donor and Stephen K Bannon a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff On Monday a British TV news report cast it in a harsher light showing video of Cambridge Analytica executives offering to entrap politicians A day later as a furor grew the company suspended its chief executive Alexander Nix The data a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times included details on users identities friend networks and likes The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned The technique had been developed at Cambridge Universitys Psychometrics Center The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica but Aleksandr Kogan a RussianAmerican psychology professor at the university was willing Dr Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm said Christopher Wylie a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analyticas data harvesting Only about 270000 users  those who participated in the survey  had consented to having their data harvested though they were all told that it was being used for academic use Facebook said no passwords or sensitive pieces of information had been taken though information about a users location was available to Cambridge Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was  not a data breach because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes  and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred to any ad network data broker or other advertising or monetizationrelated service It says that was exactly what Dr Kogan did in providing the information to a political consulting firm Dr Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica Cambridge Analytica officials after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data changed their story last week In a statement to The Times the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data though it blamed Dr Kogan for violating Facebooks rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago But the data or at least copies may still exist The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015 when it learned that Dr Kogans research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica violating its terms of service it removed Dr Kogans app from the site It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed Facebook also said Several days ago we received reports that contrary to the certifications we were given not all data was deleted We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims If true this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica Wylie and Kogan from Facebook pending further information In a further step Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr Kogan had given a verbal commitment while Mr Wylie thus far has declined Facebook already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica Investors have not been pleased sending shares of the company down more than 8 percent since Friday The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday it is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent agreement to keep users data private  In Congress Senators Amy Klobuchar a Democrat from Minnesota and John Kennedy a Republican from Louisiana have asked to hold a hearing on Facebooks links to Cambridge Analytica Republican leaders of the Senate Commerce Committee led by John Thune of South Dakota wrote a letter on Monday to Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief executive demanding answers to questions about how the data was collected  A British Parliament committee sent a letter to Mr Zuckerberg asking him to appear before the panel to answer questions on Facebooks ties to Cambridge Analytica  The attorney general of Massachusetts Maura Healey announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica she said in a Twitter post Facebooks lack of disclosure on the harvesting of data could violate privacy laws in Britain and several states WASHINGTON  Facebook on Wednesday said that the data of up to 87 million users may have been improperly shared with a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election  a figure far higher than the estimate of 50 million that had been widely cited since the leak was reported last month Mark Zuckerberg the companys chief executive also announced that Facebook would offer all of its users the same tools and controls required under European privacy rules The European rules which go into effect next month give people more control over how companies use their digital data Facebook had not previously disclosed how many accounts had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica the firm connected to the Trump campaign It has also been reluctant to disclose how it was used by Russianbacked actors to influence the 2016 presidential election Among Facebooks acknowledgments on Wednesday was the disclosure of a vulnerability in its search and account recovery functions that it said could have exposed most of its 2 billion users to having their public profile information harvested The new effort to appear more transparent about the data leaks  including a rare questionandanswer session with Mr Zuckerberg and reporters  came just before Mr Zuckerbergs expected testimony next week on Capitol Hill where he will most likely face criticism over how the company collects and shares the personal data of its users Sheryl Sandberg Mr Zuckerbergs top deputy has several national television interviews scheduled for later this week The company said that on Monday it would start telling users whether their information may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica Andy Stone a spokesman for Facebook in Washington said the 87 million figure was an estimate of the total number of users whose data could have been acquired by Cambridge Analytica He said that the estimate was calculated by adding up all the friends of the people who had logged into the Facebook app from which Cambridge Analytica collected profile data We wanted to put out the maximum number of people who could have been affected Mr Zuckerberg told reporters It remains unclear exactly how many users had their personal information accessed by Cambridge Analytica The firm said Wednesday that it had licensed data for no more than 30 million users of the social network Facebook also released a lengthy document describing how it would protect personal data in the future In that document Facebook said its search and account recovery systems had been open to abuse by anyone who already had some information about an individual such as a phone number or email address The vulnerability extended to much of the platforms user base before it was closed on Wednesday Facebook said The company also said it would limit the types of data that can be harvested by software used by outside businesses The changes mean that users will have to give permission before an app can collect information beyond their names and addresses The company also said it would no longer allow outsiders to use apps to gather information about the religious or political views of its users And it will stop using thirdparty data from companies such as Experian and Acxiom to help supplement its own data for ad targeting Its clear now that we didnt focus enough on preventing abuse Mr Zuckerberg said We didnt take a broad enough view of what our responsibility is That was a huge mistake and it was my mistake The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Facebook violated a 2011 agreement meant to protect users privacy User data is crucial to the companys business because it is used to deliver advertising to users Mr Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify about the companys handling of sensitive user data before the Senates Commerce and Judiciary committees on Tuesday and the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues said Representatives Greg Walden Republican of Oregon and Frank Pallone Democrat of New Jersey of the House committee Senator Chuck Grassley the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee said With all of the data exchanged over Facebook and other platforms users deserve to know how their information is shared and secured Facebooks problems stretch back before the reports about Cambridge Analytica to earlier investigations into how Russian actors infiltrated the platform by placing ads and posts to influence the 2016 election Mr Zuckerberg initially dismissed the idea of foreign interference on Facebook as a crazy idea Since then the company has been the focus of investigations by law enforcement and congressional committees that are delving into the Russian influence campaign Facebook now acknowledges that its platform was used to sway voters All those troubles have prompted investors to flee the company and its stock has fallen sharply in recent weeks In response the company has put its executives front and center Mr Zuckerberg typically talks to groups of reporters only after the company releases its quarterly financial reports But after not responding in public for several days following the Cambridge Analytica disclosure he has given a series of interviews And Ms Sandberg Facebooks chief operating officer and the second most recognizable face at the company is set to be interviewed this week by Fox News PBS NewsHour NBCs Today show and Bloomberg Ms Sandberg will be interviewed remotely from California Facebook said its new openness was meant to show that it takes the intense criticism over its handling of user data seriously In Washington Facebook employees and public relations firms retained by the company have talked to regulators and congressional staff members about new privacy measures including updates to policies that are intended to make them easier to understand On Wednesday Mr Zuckerberg provided a preview of what he will tell Congress next week He said Facebook was an idealistic and optimistic company But he acknowledged that the company had committed serious errors by not ensuring that robust safeguards were in place for users Asked if he should still be leading the company he said Yes Life is about learning from the mistakes and learning what you need to go forward Terrell McSweeny a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission said that Mr Zuckerberg has a big task ahead of him in Washington I think it is important for Zuckerberg to clearly explain how Facebook plans to earn back consumer trust Ms McSweeny said Consumers need reassurance that their data are not being misused NAIROBI  A data analytics firm at the center of a controversy over its  acquisition and use of personal Facebook data in the 2016 United States presidential election is under new scrutiny for its role in Kenyas presidential election last year Senior officials of Cambridge Analytica whose parent company is the SCL Group said in an undercover video by Channel 4 News of Britain that the company played a critical role in President Uhuru Kenyattas two campaigns in 2013 and 2017 The revelations come only weeks after Mr Kenyatta and his chief rival Raila Odinga reconciled after months of contention In the video Mark Turnbull a Cambridge Analytica executive said the company twice rebranded Mr Kenyattas political party wrote his campaign speeches and his political platform and twice conducted surveys of 50000 people to ascertain Kenyan voters hope and fears A spokesman for Mr Kenyatta referred inquiries to his party the Jubilee Party whose top official did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday night Mr Kenyatta won reelection last October after two presidential votes The first in August was nullified by the Supreme Court which cited widespread irregularities and ordered a second election Mr Odinga pulled out of the second vote which was held in October saying the process was unfair The acrimonious political season included divisive speech by both parties observers said and continued well past Mr Kenyattas inauguration The two archrivals shook hands and reconciled  this month Moses Karanja a researcher on a project at Strathmore Law School in Nairobi about social media and misinformation during the presidential election said the recent reports about Cambridge Analyticas role in Kenya and its abuse of Facebook data globally reinforced concerns raised in his own work about how Kenyans personal data was accessed by political parties and even by government institutions like the elections commission He said targeted text messages that he and others received during the campaign season suggested that individuals voter registration information social media data and telephone numbers were being independently linked  although its still unclear how We dont know how they accessed this data or how it all ended up being linked to phone numbers and such Mr Karanja said For me thats scary Those are questions those platforms should answer Gacheke Gachihi who leads the Mathare Social Justice Center in Nairobi said Cambridge Analyticas branding for Mr Kenyatta was divisive propaganda raising ethnic enmity The way you paint your opponent you paint also his supporters he said and you and your ethnic base will feel like This man is a devil That undermines the work we are trying to do for social justice Local news media had reported last spring that Mr Kenyattas party had retained Cambridge Analytica for his reelection campaign And David Murathe the vice chairman of the Jubilee Party told Reuters on Tuesday that SCL helped the campaign with branding last year Mr Odingas party also enlisted a datadriven political consulting firm but its ontheground team was deported from Kenya just a week before the election according to The Los Angeles Times On its website Cambridge Analytica names Kenya as one of its political case studies describing a 47000person survey it conducted in 2013 to identify Kenyan voters real needs jobs and fears tribal violence as well as their preferred information channels The company also said it targeted youth voters with a social media campaign Cambridge Analyticas parent group SCL described similar activities on an archived page of its website and said it also advised on communications branding and strategy during the electoral period Cambridge said its survey was the largest political research project ever conducted in East Africa Mr Turnbull told Channel 4s undercover reporter that it repeated the survey in 2017 Those survey results Mr Karanja said could reverberate beyond social media campaigns and be translated into nonInternet platforms like radio television advertisements and billboards He said his research team documented several examples of misinformation spreading on WhatsApp and other social media and filtering down to local talk radio shows or newspaper articles British investigators on Friday night searched the London offices of Cambridge Analytica the dataanalytics company that harvested data from 50 million Facebook users to develop psychological profiles on behalf of political campaigns including that of President Trump About 20 investigators from Britains data watchdog the Information Commissioners Office descended on the companys offices on New Oxford Street after obtaining a search warrant from the High Court We are pleased with the decision of the judge and the warrant is now being executed the office of the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said in a statement This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data and analytics for political purposes As you will expect we will now need to collect assess and consider the evidence before coming to any conclusions Last Saturday the same day The New York Times and The Observer of London published a detailed look at the companys use of Facebook data Ms Denhams office announced an investigation into the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used The office said the inquiry would consider how political parties and campaigns data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analyzing peoples personal information to micro target voters The police search carried out on Friday night had been expected The revelations about the companys data use have set off a storm on both sides of the Atlantic European and American lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the British consulting firm gained access to the Facebook data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users The companys stock has taken a hit and some consumers have stopped using Facebook The companys chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company mishandled data and promised to do better The Information Commissioners Office has described its investigation as complex and farreaching and said that it would pursue criminal or civil enforcement vigorously WASHINGTON  Sitting in a hotel bar Alexander Nix who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter Mr Nix said or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe We have a long history of working behind the scenes Mr Nix said The prospective client though was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica the data firm with ties to President Trumps 2016 campaign The results of Channel 4s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters The weekends reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica Now the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company which was founded by Stephen K Bannon and Robert Mercer a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least 15 million into Cambridge Analytica The firms socalled psychographic modeling techniques which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016 though many have questioned their effectiveness Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company the SCL Group have done outside the United States The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined Mr Nix for instance holds dual appointments at the two companies Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family but it is effectively a shell  it holds intellectual property rights to its socalled psychographic modeling tools yet its clients are served by the staff at Londonbased SCL and overseen by Mr Nix who is a British citizen SCL Elections has clients around the world and it has experimented with datadriven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide governmentheld data according to former employees ALSO READ How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data Triggering a New Outcry But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4 Mr Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica Many of our clients dont want to be seen to be working with a foreign company he told the Channel 4 reporter who was not identified We can set up fake IDs and websites we can be students doing research projects attached to a university we can be tourists Theres so many options we can look at The Channel 4 reporter posed as a fixer for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January all of which were secretly filmed Mr Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put into the bloodstream to the internet said Mark Turnbull another Cambridge executive in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London Then watch it grow give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape he added It has to happen without anyone thinking Thats propaganda Because the moment you think thats propaganda the next question is Whos put that out The most damning footage though was of Mr Nixs suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery At a meeting in January also at the Berkeley hotel Mr Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client I mean deep digging is interesting he said But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal thats too good to be true and make sure that thats videorecorded you know These sorts of tactics are very effective instantly having video evidence of corruption putting it on the internet these sorts of things Mr Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance he said Well have the whole thing recorded on cameras Or Mr Nix said they could send some girls around to the candidates house  we have lots of history of things The reporter asked what kind of girls and Mr Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women Im just saying we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know Mr Nix replied You know what Im saying They are very beautiful he said I find that works very well To be sure though Mr Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals Please dont pay too much attention to what Im saying because Im just giving you examples of what can be done and what what has been done he said Cambridge Analytica in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast said the report was edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent Mr Nix and Mr Turnbull humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions it said They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again the company said For Mr Nix the footage comes at an already perilous moment Earlier this month he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britains referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday Damian Collins the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry said he planned to call Mr Nix back to testify It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament Mr Collins said in a statement this weekend Elizabeth Denham the British information commissioner told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica setting a deadline of 6 pm Monday Ms Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant We need to look at the databases we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed she said In a statement Facebook said that it had hired a digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica But Mr Collins who is chairman of the House of Commons digital culture media and sport committee said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did What are they doing Mr Collins asked on Channel 4 News Are they going in to physically recover data to disturb the files This investigation should be for the authorities Mr Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his companys actions Christopher Wylie would be giving evidence to his committee He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg or another senior executive from Facebook to do the same"
