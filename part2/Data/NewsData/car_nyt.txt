"cWaymo the driverlesscar company that was spun out of Google has pushed farther ahead in selfdriving cars than any of the automakers or other technology companies trying to pioneer the field It has been working on its software sensors and other gear for nine years It has 600 or more test vehicles operating in at least four cities around the country Its vehicles have racked up more than five million miles of testing on public roads Now even as a cloud hangs over driverlesscar testing after a rivals fatal crash Waymo is vowing to shift its operations into overdrive In the next two years it intends to put thousands of selfdriving cars on the road in selected cities to ferry not its own engineers but ordinary people from place to place In Phoenix where it plans to introduce the service first Waymo predicts it will carry paying customers almost anywhere they want to go in an area covering 100 square miles the companys chief executive John Krafcik told reporters Tuesday on the eve of the New York International Auto Show Members of the public will be able to take our cars anywhere in our service area Mr Krafcik said We will be driving everywhere  dense urban centers highspeed roads lowspeed roads suburbs Theres every driving scenario to be imagined The company said it planned to buy as many as 20000 electric cars from Jaguar Land Rover and outfit them with the radars cameras and sensors it has developed to enable the vehicles to drive themselves on public roads The deal could be worth 1 billion Its an audacious vision that goes far beyond even the most optimistic plans of its rivals General Motors for example also intends to start a ride service that uses robotic cars that have no driver But GM says its service wont get off the ground until late 2019  a time when Waymo said its fleet would be providing as many as one million rides a day Mike Ramsey an analyst at Gartner who tracks autonomousvehicle development said it would not surprise him if Waymo achieved its ambitious timetable But he added I anticipate a rollout that will be less than perfect and at times will be a bit slow and clunky Waymos aggressive plans are all the more striking given the setback to another contender in the driverless push the ridehailing service Uber One of Ubers selfdriving vehicles struck and killed a woman last week in Tempe Ariz in what is believed to be the first pedestrian death involving autonomous driving As a result its road testing has been halted in Arizona California Pittsburgh and Toronto Selfdriving vehicles will take some time to overcome the critical performance and safety challenges Bill Fay Toyotas senior vice president for automotive operations in North America said Tuesday at an autoindustry conference hosted by J D Power and Associates Toyota like GM is setting a more deliberate pace in its driverless program And Waymo as it moves into commercial operations is likely to encounter questions that have not been addressed such as how driverless cars will be insured whether the federal government will regulate their use and what role the local authorities will play The gap between testing fleets of vehicles and implementing them in real commercial fleets is going to be significant said Mr Ramsey the Gartner analyst Until now Waymo has been using a fleet of more than 600 vehicles most of them Chrysler Pacifica minivans for its road tests It agreed to use the new Jaguar IPace a batterypowered hatchback unveiled this month for the service announced Tuesday After testing the company expects to start its ride service by the end of the year Mr Krafcik the Waymo chief said the company intended to move forward rapidly with a driverless ride service for the public because it was confident its vehicles could operate safely in virtually any driving situation where they would be put into use In addition to the five million miles its cars have driven in tests Waymo has run computer simulations equivalent to five billion miles of testing In these computer models Waymo uses software to make virtual test drives even more complicated by adding more pedestrians and making distances between cars shorter than in typical road situations he said At a closed site in California Waymo also tests the performance of its cars in traffic situations based on actual crashes We think we will be the safety benchmark for the world said Mr Krafcik who worked in operations at Ford and then was Hyundais United States chief before his arrival at Waymo He noted that Waymo cars were equipped with highly sensitive cameras radar and three different types of lidar  a kind of radar based on lasers  to identify objects pedestrians and other cars Even with the vast computing power of Google which operates giant data centers around the world Waymo wont be able to train its computerized driver to be prepared for everything There are going to be things we cant predict Adam Jonas an automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley said at the J D Power conference The Uber crash at about 10 pm on March 18 involved a Volvo XC90 sportutility vehicle outfitted with radar cameras and other sensors and computer gear to enable it to navigate without input from a driver Elaine Herzberg 49 was walking her bicycle across the road at a spot without a crosswalk when she was struck Videos taken by cameras mounted in the Uber vehicle show the safety driver was looking down just before the impact The Uber crash prompted Toyota to suspend testing its selfdriving cars on public roads as a precaution although Ford Motor and General Motors said they were proceeding with their efforts Repeating comments he had made over the weekend Mr Krafcik said he believed that a Waymo vehicle would have been able to detect the pedestrian and avoid a crash He also clarified the business Waymo is pursuing explaining that the company did not intend to make cars itself It wants to develop selfdriving technology that it can put into cars made by partners and intends to operate them in a ride service Waymo also expects to put its technology into trucks and delivery vehicles as well as buses or other vehicles that ferry riders to mass transportation systems And it hopes to license the technology to carmakers auto technology suppliers or other companies Mr Krafcik said Waymo expected these efforts to become a highly profitable business but declined to say how long that could take Alphabet the parent of Waymo and Google tends to take a very longterm approach he said The advent of selfdriving cars the subject of so much fanfare over the last few years from automakers and technology companies may be just around the corner  at least according to General Motors On Friday GM said it had submitted a petition to the United States Department of Transportation seeking permission to begin operating fully autonomous cars  without steering wheels or pedals  in a commercial ridehailing service next year Whats more the company said the vehicle the Cruise AV could be put into production on a standard assembly line once approval was granted by the federal government and states where the cars would operate Selfdriving technology is only going to have a big impact if we can deploy it at large scale GMs chief financial officer Dan Ammann said in an interview We intend to launch a commercial rideshare service at commercial scale in 2019 That will begin in one city and scale up in that city and move to other cities after that The cars would most likely be used initially in a ride service created by GM rather than in a service run by an established company like Uber or Lyft Mr Ammann said If approved the Cruise AVs would probably appear first in San Francisco or Scottsdale Ariz where GMs selfdriving subsidiary Cruise Automation is conducting tests In San Francisco the division has set up a ridehailing service using about 50 Cruise AVs although the cars are available only for some of its 250 employees not public customers The Cruise AV is a version of the batterypowered Chevrolet Bolt Mr Ammann said it was reasonable to assume that mass production of the selfdriving model would take place at a factory in Orion Township Mich that already makes Cruise AV prototypes and the Bolt though he said there were no firm plans With its announcement GM appears to have a jump in the race to field selfdriving cars Ford Motor is also developing a car with no steering wheel or pedals but has said it wont go into mass production until 2021 The Cruise AV is a fourpassenger vehicle with an array of radar cameras and laser sensors that are clustered on its roof and allow the car to navigate city streets and recognize vehicles pedestrians intersections and other obstacles Since it does not have a steering wheel it has two passenger seats in front and a center console with a display screen and a few buttons and knobs for audio and climate control GMs petition calls for producing up to 2500 Cruise AVs for use in commercial ride fleets Mass production and government regulation appear to be within General Motors grasp said Karl Brauer a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book an automotive data firm If government approval is granted and GM begins providing autonomous taxi service to end users in multiple markets well officially be living in a world of selfdriving cars Approval from the Transportation Department is expected to take several months and then GM would need local clearance before it could provide rides in Cruise AVs to the public Mr Ammann said it was not clear how the departments main autosafety regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would evaluate GMs petition and whether the agency would test the vehicles itself The safety agency said Friday that it would give GMs petition careful consideration Local approval will depend on each states regulations Mr Ammann said Michigan for example already allows cars with no steering wheels to operate on public roads Other states would need to decide how to treat driverless cars Industry analysts say automakers and technology companies could generate billions of dollars in revenue and profit by selling or leasing selfdriving cars to ride services taxi fleets and delivery companies Ford said this week that it would work with Dominos Pizza and a startup delivery company Postmates to use its autonomous prototypes in limited commercial tests this year Waymo the autonomousvehicle company spun out of Google is testing its own fully autonomous cars in Arizona and California Lyft and a technology startup called Nutonomy recently began testing selfdriving cars in Boston Uber is running a pilot program in Pittsburgh Tesla GM Audi and other automakers are also developing driverassistance systems that take over for drivers in certain conditions such as cruising along a divided highway Those technologies however require drivers to remain alert and are considered years away from becoming fully autonomous systems GM is convinced that selfdriving cars can play a significant role in reducing deaths and injuries from auto crashes Traffic accidents kill more than 35000 people a year and 95 percent result from driver errors Ride services with selfdriving cars could also make it easier to get around without owning or renting a car  and producing those cars would help GM weather a shift away from individual ownership Ultimately we see a very big business opportunity around this Mr Ammann said SAN FRANCISCO  The ridehailing service Lyft has agreed to alliances with just about anyone working on driverless car technology Its latest partnership aims to make its autonomous vehicle technology available to any car manufacturer Lyft said Wednesday that it had reached a deal with Magna International one of the worlds biggest auto suppliers to jointly develop and manufacture selfdriving car systems The companies said they will work together to introduce autonomous vehicles to Lyfts ridehailing network At the same time Magna can sell the driverlesscar technology to any customer  including other technology companies Magna also said it would invest 200 million in Lyfts latest fundraising round lifting the San Franciscobased companys valuation to 117 billion The partnership reflects Lyfts openarms approach to autonomous vehicles Lyft has opened its ridehailing network to other companies working on selfdriving cars including Ford and General Motors a major Lyft investor so they can gain realworld experience by picking up passengers and collecting data Uber Lyfts main rival has been developing selfdriving technology mostly on its own Waymo a Lyft partner is slowly introducing its own ridehailing service using autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans equipped with Waymos own hardware and software The hype over selfdriving cars has made development of the technology challenging for some traditional automakers Car companies face huge salaries for top artificial intelligence engineers and limited access to data and key components The competitive landscape is so charged that it has already given birth to at least one highprofile lawsuit As a result automakers are confronting a choice Pay big for a technology startup or risk falling behind Last year Ford announced it would invest 1 billion in Argo AI an artificial intelligence startup focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology GM acquired Cruise for an estimated 1 billion in cash stock and incentive packages in 2016 the same year it invested 500 million in Lyft After lagging behind Uber Lyft has recently made a concerted push into selfdriving cars The company opened a research facility in Palo Alto Calif and has aggressively recruited engineers It also has a major asset for selfdriving technology  a ridehailing network picking up and dropping off passengers 10 million times a week This provides Lyft with a customer base to introduce and test the vehicles and a way to collect information that can be used to train autonomous cars But Raj Kapoor Lyfts chief strategy officer said it would be a few years before truly autonomous vehicles were ready for the road I believe this relationship will get us there faster Mr Kapoor said Magna a Canadian auto parts maker already supplies a wide range of driverassist technology to its customers including a system for staying in lanes automatic emergency braking and rearview cameras It also builds entire vehicles for customers like MercedesBenz BMW and Jaguar  a capability that has made the company a potential partner for a new entrant like Apple Magna has already been working on hardware for selfdriving cars including radar and lidar  an abbreviation for light detection and ranging  that help the vehicles see the world around them But Magna said the partnership with Lyft would be essential to helping it push further into autonomous vehicles combining its automotive and manufacturing experience with Lyfts ride network to better understand the many situations that a selfdriving car will encounter The question isnt whether autonomous vehicles are going to happen but how long the transition is said Swamy Kotagiri Magnas chief technology officer Under the partnership Lyft would take the lead in developing selfdriving car technology while Magna would oversee manufacturing of the systems The two companies would share the development costs and the resulting intellectual property Lyft compared its strategy of operating its own selfdriving cars as well as welcoming driverless cars from other companies to the way Amazon is both a retailer selling products to customers directly and an online virtual mall providing space for other companies to sell goods on the site SAN FRANCISCO  For weeks Dara Khosrowshahi Ubers chief executive and some of his lieutenants had worked behind the scenes to repair the ridehailing companys fractious relationship with Waymo the selfdriving business spun out of Google A Waymo lawsuit over autonomous car technology in which it accused Uber of stealing trade secrets was about to go to trial in a San Francisco courtroom for all to see So Mr Khosrowshahi who was appointed Uber CEO late last year leaned on his history with Google from his previous job as chief executive of the travel site Expedia Mr Khosrowshahi worked to coax Googles founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and to let them know that Uber had turned over a new leaf according to two people briefed on the situation who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential Tony West Ubers recently appointed general counsel and a former Department of Justice official also jumped into the negotiations these people said The actions helped lead to a compromise On Friday four days after the trial began and revealed some embarrassing testimony Uber and Waymo announced they had settled the trade secrets dispute Under the agreement Waymo dropped the suit and will receive 034 percent of stock in Uber Uber also said that it could have handled some past actions around driverless car tech differently The settlement signified something else too Uber is Mr Khosrowshahis company now Since stepping inside Ubers doors last fall the 48yearold has made it clear he wants to put the companys checkered past behind it as fast as possible With the Waymo deal he showed the many tactics that he plans to use to accomplish that  expressions of regret accompanied by conciliation compromise and efficiency Call him the diplomat in chief Mr Khosrowshahis modus operandi is to clear the way for the big tasks ahead for Uber said the people who were briefed on the matter One of those tasks is taking the ridehailing company public next year in what is likely to be a blockbuster initial public offering As a private company Uber is valued at around 70 billion My job as Ubers CEO is to set the course for the future of the company innovating and growing responsibly as well as acknowledging and correcting mistakes of the past Mr Khosrowshahi said in a company blog post His fans applauded the Waymo compromise This is what real leadership looks like Chris Sacca a venture capitalist who was an early investor in Uber said in a tweet Acknowledgement apology commitment optimism The deal with Waymo is the latest maneuver by Mr Khosrowshahi to shed the baggage of Ubers past For months he has been on a mea culpa tour to mend fences with legislators around the world for how Uber often barreled into markets while flouting local laws He has publicly apologized for an enormous hack that briefly compromised the information of 57 million drivers and riders And he has introduced a new set of cultural values for Uber replacing a list created by Travis Kalanick the former chief executive who was pushed out last June Internally at Uber Mr Khosrowshahi has also made changes including bringing on a new slate of lieutenants In December the ridehailing company said Barney Harford a former chief executive of the travel site Orbitz would become its chief operating officer In October Uber hired Mr West a former federal prosecutor from PepsiCo Mr West has since been restructuring the companys legal department Mr Khosrowshahis style is markedly different from that of Mr Kalanick who took a noholdsbarred approach to the business world In court this week for the trade secrets trial Mr Kalanick testified that he had moved from seeing Google as a potential partner for Uber to an existential threat Googles selfdriving vehicle research he said could eventually have crushed Uber Mr Kalanick also testified that he became friendly with Anthony Levandowski a former top selfdriving researcher at Google Mr Levandowski started a selfdriving trucking startup Otto with the help of other Google engineers he took with him while downloading proprietary information from the company Mr Kalanick bought Otto in 2016 an acquisition that led to Waymos case against Uber Uber has since fired Mr Levandowski On Friday Mr Kalanick struck a defiant tone about the settlement Our sole objective was to hire the most talented scientists and engineers to help lead the company and our cities to a driverless future he said in a statement The evidence at trial overwhelmingly proved that and had the trial proceeded to its conclusion it is clear Uber would have prevailed For now Mr Khosrowshahi has appeared to smooth over the sore spots with Waymo Waymo will still be able to pursue a separate legal proceeding against Mr Levandowski which is unfolding as a closeddoor arbitration While I cannot erase the past I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from it and it will inform our actions going forward Mr Khosrowshahi said in his blog post SAN FRANCISCO  Arizona officials saw opportunity when Uber and other companies began testing driverless cars a few years ago Promising to keep oversight light they invited the companies to test their robotic vehicles on the states roads Then on Sunday night an autonomous car operated by Uber  and with an emergency backup driver behind the wheel  struck and killed a woman on a street in Tempe Ariz It was believed to be the first pedestrian death associated with selfdriving technology The company quickly suspended testing in Tempe as well as in Pittsburgh San Francisco and Toronto The accident was a reminder that selfdriving technology is still in the experimental stage and governments are still trying to figure out how to regulate it Uber Waymo and a long list of tech companies and automakers have begun to expand testing of their selfdriving vehicles in cities around the country The companies say the cars will be safer than regular cars simply because they take easily distracted humans out of the driving equation But the technology is still only about a decade old and just now starting to experience the unpredictable situations that drivers can face It was not yet clear if the crash in Arizona will lead other companies or state regulators to slow the rollout of selfdriving vehicles on public roads Much of the testing of autonomous cars has taken place in a piecemeal regulatory environment Some states like Arizona have taken a lenient approach to regulation Arizona officials wanted to lure companies working on selfdriving technology out of neighboring California where regulators had been less receptive Read more on how Arizona became a destination for selfdriving car tests But regulators in California and elsewhere have become more accommodating lately In April California is expected to follow Arizonas lead and allow companies to test cars without a person in the drivers seat Federal policymakers have also considered a lighter touch A Senate bill if passed would free autonomouscar makers from some existing safety standards and preempt states from creating their own vehicle safety laws Similar legislation has been passed in the House The Senate version has passed a committee vote but hasnt reached a full floor vote This tragic incident makes clear that autonomous vehicle technology has a long way to go before it is truly safe for the passengers pedestrians and drivers who share Americas roads said Senator Richard Blumenthal Democrat of Connecticut The Uber car a Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle outfitted with the companys sensing system was in autonomous mode with a human safety driver at the wheel but carrying no passengers when it struck Elaine Herzberg a 49yearold woman on Sunday around 10 pm Sgt Ronald Elcock a Tempe police spokesman said during a news conference that a preliminary investigation showed that the vehicle was moving around 40 miles per hour when it struck Ms Herzberg who was walking with her bicycle on the street He said it did not appear as though the car had slowed down before impact and that the Uber safety driver had shown no signs of impairment The weather was clear and dry Uber said it would work with the police Our hearts go out to the victims family an Uber spokeswoman Sarah Abboud said in a statement We are fully cooperating with local authorities in their investigation of this incident Tempe with its dry weather and wide roads was considered an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles In 2015 Arizona officials declared the state a regulationfree zone in order to attract testing operations from companies like Uber Waymo and Lyft We needed our message to Uber Lyft and other entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley to be that Arizona was open to new ideas Doug Ducey Arizonas governor said in an interview in June 2017 Using an executive order Mr Ducey opened the state to testing of autonomous vehicles that had safety drivers at the wheel ready to take over in an emergency He updated that mandate earlier this month to allow testing of unmanned selfdriving cars noting that a businessfriendly and low regulatory environment had helped the states economy Even when an Uber selfdriving car and another vehicle collided in Tempe in March 2017 city police and Mr Ducey said that extra safety regulations werent necessary the other driver was at fault not the selfdriving vehicle But on Monday Mark Mitchell Tempes mayor called Ubers decision to suspend autonomous vehicle testing a responsible step and cautioned people from drawing conclusions prematurely Daniel Scarpinato a spokesman for Mr Ducey said the updated order from the governor provides enhanced enforcement measures and clarity on responsibility in these accidents In California where testing without a backup driver was just weeks away from being permitted Jessica Gonzalez a spokeswoman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles said officials were in the process of gathering more information about the Tempe crash Waymo Lyft and Cruise an autonomous vehicle company owned by General Motors did not respond to requests for comment In a news release the National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team of four investigators to examine the vehicles interaction with the environment other vehicles and vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and bicyclists Since late last year Waymo the selfdriving car unit of Googles parent company Alphabet has been using cars without a human in the drivers seat to pick up and drop off passengers in Arizona Most testing of driverless cars occurs with a safety driver in the front seat who is available to take over if something goes wrong It can be challenging however to take control of a fastmoving vehicle California requires companies to report the number of instances when human drivers are forced to take over for the autonomous vehicle called disengagements Between December 2016 and November 2017 Waymos selfdriving cars drove about 350000 miles and human drivers retook the wheel 63 times  an average of about 5600 miles between every disengagement Uber has not been testing its selfdriving cars long enough in California to be required to release its disengagement numbers Researchers working on autonomous technology have struggled with how to teach the systems to adjust for unpredictable human driving or behavior Still most researchers believe selfdriving cars will ultimately be more safe than their human counterparts In 2016 37461 people died in trafficrelated accidents in the United States according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration That amounts to 118 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled in 2016 Waymo which has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2009 when it was Googles selfdriving car project has said its cars have driven more than 5 million miles while Ubers cars have covered 3 million miles In 2016 a man driving his Tesla using Autopilot the car companys selfdriving feature died on a state highway in Florida when his car crashed into a tractortrailer that was crossing the road Federal regulators later ruled there were no defects in the system to cause the accident But the crash in Tempe will draw attention among the general public to selfdriving cars said Michael Bennett an associate research professor at Arizona State University who has been looking into how people respond to driverless cars and artificial intelligence Weve imagined an event like this as a huge inflection point for the technology and the companies advocating for it he said Theyre going to have to do a lot to prove that the technology is safe SAN FRANCISCO  For years Uber secretly spied on key executives drivers and employees at rival ridehailing companies as part of a larger intelligencegathering operation that spanned multiple countries according to a letter made public in a federal court on Friday The 37page letter written on behalf of Richard Jacobs a former Uber security employee detailed what he described as the formation of separate internal teams designed expressly for the purpose of acquiring trade secrets from major ridesharing competitors around the world Those teams then worked to infiltrate chat rooms and scraped websites for data on competitors according to the letter Uber security employees occasionally impersonated drivers to gain access to chat groups illegally recorded phone calls and secretly wiretapped and tailed executives at rival companies over the course of 2016 the letter said Uber has engaged and continues to engage in illegal intelligence gathering on a global scale Mr Jacobs wrote His letter underscores the lengths that Uber went to in order to get ahead of rivals under its former chief executive Travis Kalanick when it prized aggressiveness and the growth of its ridehailing business above all else The company is now trying to shift away from that image and stabilize after a year filled with scandals executive departures and internal battles Mr Kalanick stepped down in June and his successor Dara Khosrowshahi has been on an apology tour for Ubers past behavior Mr Jacobss letter is part of a trade secrets case that Uber is fighting against Waymo the selfdrivingautomobile business that operates under Googles parent company Waymo has said Uber stole information about driverlesscar technology from it Uber has denied Waymos allegations and the case is scheduled to go to trial next month Mr Jacobss letter surfaced last month when the United States attorneys office in Northern California alerted the federal judge in the UberWaymo case to its existence The letter was submitted into evidence because it also detailed allegations that Uber employees potentially conspired to steal trade secrets from Waymo The judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco then delayed a trial in the case so Waymos lawyers could gather more information on the claims At the time Mr Jacobs appeared in court about his letter In his testimony he walked back some of its claims including those pertaining to Ubers alleged theft of Waymos trade secrets Uber had privately settled a lawsuit by Mr Jacobs for millions of dollars this year The document nonetheless paints a picture of Ubers other competitive tactics which Mr Jacobs said had been carried out by Ubers security team with Mr Kalanicks knowledge At the time the team was led by Joe Sullivan the companys chief security officer Mr Jacobss letter said that after the Uber teams followed rival executives to hotels or private meeting spaces they relayed their actions to Mr Kalanick In one instance Uber security officials passed along the reactions of executives from a competing company when they received the news that Uber was to receive a venture capital investment of more than 3 billion from Saudi Arabian investors While we havent substantiated all the claims in this letter  and importantly any related to Waymo  our new leadership has made clear that going forward we will compete honestly and fairly on the strength of our ideas and technology Matt Kallman a spokesman for Uber said in a statement after the letters release Uber is facing at least five separate federal investigations including at least one over a software tool called Greyball which the company created to evade law enforcement in cities around the world It is also facing an investigation into whether the company broke the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for bribery overseas a claim Mr Jacobs made in his letter Two of Ubers top security officials  including Mr Sullivan and Craig Clark a lawyer on Mr Sullivans team  were let go this month after the company disclosed that it had covered up a 2016 hacking that affected the accounts of more than 50 million drivers and riders On Friday Mr Sullivan and others on the security team disputed Mr Jacobss letter saying it was nothing more than character assassination for cash according to a statement from Matthew Umhofer an attorney for four Uber security employees Jacobs took the good work my clients did and twisted it into something it wasnt Mr Umhofer said In his own statement Mr Sullivan said From where I sat my team acted ethically with integrity and in the best interests of our drivers and riders Through a spokeswoman Mr Kalanick declined to comment SAN FRANCISCO  No one knows what the future of selfdriving cars will look like or how long it will take to get there But every major player in the field is striking partnerships to be ready for the day when autonomous vehicles finally become mainstream That includes Uber which on Monday announced a new deal with Volvo Under the agreement Uber plans to purchase as many as 24000 selfdriving Volvos once the technology is productionready putting the vehicles into its extensive ridehailing network Everything were doing right now is about building autonomous vehicles at scale Jeff Miller Ubers head of automotive alliances said in an interview We dont know exactly how an autonomous world will look But we know that we want to be the platform thats at the center of it from a ridesharing standpoint The deal is an extension of an agreement Uber made with Volvo nearly two years ago when the ridehailing company started its research and development efforts in autonomous vehicles in earnest Uber has worked with thirdparty component manufacturers to build software and hardware for driverless cars then worked closely with Volvo to outfit the automakers XC90 vehicles with the technology But the new deal vastly increases the number of Volvo driverless cars that Uber can work with showing the scope of its ambitions Volvo which is based in Sweden and owned by Geely Automobile Holdings of China said in a statement that Volvo and Uber were contributing 300 million to the project From automakers like Ford Tesla and General Motors to technology companies like Google Uber and Lyft titans of the transportation industry are racing to gain an edge in a future of autonomous vehicles Each of the players has approached the issue differently Automakers like GM and Ford have spent billions buying softwarebased startups to work on integrating driverless technology into their vehicles Tesla has long offered a hybrid version of selfdriving software in its vehicles and recently debuted an electric nearly autonomous semi truck that it expects to hit the road in the next few years Uber has done most of its work in research and development inhouse instead of teaming up with multiple manufacturers as has been the case with Lyft Ubers largest rival in the United States In particular Uber has invested in its Advanced Technologies Group home to hundreds of engineers in Pittsburgh where it is doing much of its autonomous vehicle research The only way we could control our own destiny was to work with this technology that had the potential to disrupt our business and have direct involvement in the creation of it Mr Miller said We couldnt afford to be on the outside looking in We have to be in the game Some of Ubers work in selfdriving cars has run into hurdles The company has been fighting a lawsuit from Waymo Googles onetime autonomous car business over stolen trade secrets Uber has expanded its partnerships over the past year striking deals with automakers like Daimler to bring autonomous cars onto the ridehailing companys network Mr Miller said that Uber would own and operate fleets of its own vehicles purchased from partners like Volvo but that there was no onesizefitsall approach so it would also allow other selfdriving vehicles on its network"
