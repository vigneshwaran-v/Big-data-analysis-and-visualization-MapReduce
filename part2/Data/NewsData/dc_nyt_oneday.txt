"cSAN FRANCISCO   California's public utility regulator on Friday signaled it would allow selfdriving car companies to transport passengers without a backup driver in the vehicle a step forward for autonomous car developers just as the industry faces heightened scrutiny over safety concerns The California Public Utilities Commission the body that regulates utilities including transportation companies such as ridehailing apps issued a proposal that could clear the way for companies such as Alphabet Inc's Waymo and General Motors Co to give members of the public a ride in a selfdriving car without any backup driver present which has been the practice of most companies so far The California Department of Motor Vehicles had already issued rules allowing for autonomous vehicle testing without drivers which took effect this week The commission said its proposed rules complement the existing DMV rules but provide additional protections for passengers The proposal which is set to be voted on at the commission's meeting next month would clear the way for autonomous vehicle companies to do more testing and get the public more closely acquainted with driverless cars in a state that has closely regulated the industry It also comes as regulators across the country are taking a harder look at selfdriving cars in the aftermath of a crash in Arizona that killed a pedestrian Last month an Uber SUV operating in selfdriving mode struck and killed a 49yearold woman in the first known fatality caused by a driverless car Uber UBERUL suspended its selfdriving car operations and the crash remains under investigation by federal safety officials The proposed California rules require that companies hold an autonomous vehicle testing permit from the DMV for at least 90 days before picking up passengers The service must be free  companies are not allowed to accept payment from passengers  passengers must be 18 years or older and no airport trips are allowed The proposal also mandates that companies file regular reports to regulators including the number of miles their selfdriving vehicles travel rides they complete and disabled passengers they are serving Reporting by

accident in which she was severely injured The suit by Kelly Roadman contends the shrine acted as a distraction when another driver struck her car in October 2016 The home in Unity Township Pennsylvania that became known as the Trump House was painted like an American flag with a 12foothigh waving Trump cutout out front The TribuneReview reports that Roadman's car was struck when a driver tried to turn left to view the display She is seeking more than 30000 in damages The property owner could not be reached for comment LONDON   Jackie Stewart has only ever had one answer when asked who was the finest driver he raced against in Formula One Jim Clark Saturday is the 50th anniversary of the death of one of the sport's alltime greats in a Formula Two crash at Germany's Hockenheim circuit on April 7 1968 While millions around the world were plunged onto mourning by the death of Brazil's triple world champion Ayrton Senna at Imola in May 1994 the Scot's accident left a previous generation just as stunned That afternoon like the one in Italy a quarter of a century later had similarly farreaching consequences for driver safety If Jim Clark could die anybody could die Stewart who had shared an apartment with his compatriot and close friend told Reuters before traveling to this weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix Jimmys death at Hockenheim was the beginning of us really driving home the reality that has changed the entire world of Formula One  in regards to track safety added the triple world champion He was almost bulletproof said the 78yearold He drove in such a smooth and calculated way that he never overdrove He was never a driver anybody would have ever thought would have died in a racing car And suddenly the sport allowed that to happen because there were no barriers and no protection from those trees that the car catapulted into Clark as quiet and indecisive out of the car as he was commanding in it lost control at speed possibly due to a deflated rear tire on his Lotus and somersaulted into trees There were no television images no photographs other than of the wreckage The 1963 and 1965 world champion who had won more grands prix than any driver at that time including seven victories in a single season and a total of 25 from 72 starts died instantly of a broken neck He was 32 EMPTY PHONE CALL Stewart was in Spain at the time carrying out a track inspection at the Jarama circuit near Madrid for the grand prix drivers' association It was a few days before I moved to living in Switzerland Helen Stewart's wife was already in Switzerland when I called her up And of course she had heard about it as well he recalled We had an empty phone call Neither of us could really speak April 7 that year was the first in a deadly sequence that followed on the same weekend of successive months British driver Mike Spence a former team mate of Stewart's at BRM died on May 7 at Indianapolis Italian Ludovico Scarfiotti was killed on June 8 in practice for a hillclimb race and on July 7 Frenchman Jo Schlesser died at the wheel of a Honda during the French Grand Prix at Rouen The old Nuerburgring the most dangerous track of all at the time was the early August race Stewart famously won by more than four minutes in rain and fog but his immediate thoughts were for the safety of others at the 'Green Hell' I won the race and because of those four consecutive months and mine was the fifth month in conditions that were appalling the first question I asked was is everybody alright he said Clark who would have been godson to Stewart's second son Mark was one of many who died in motorsport's most dangerous era but Stewart said the accident did not change his commitment to racing That sounds rather hardnosed but racing drivers of that period were very strange people in many respects We were going to more funerals than anybody would ever go to he said And these were people we lived with we traveled with we holidayed with and raced with The Scot now busy campaigning to find a cure for the dementia his wife suffers      has helped ensure memories are kept alive in a revamped museum being built at Duns in the Scottish borders Many of the visitors are Americans fascinated to find out more about the quiet sheep farmer who spent his entire career with Lotus and also won the Indianapolis 500 in 1965 Clark is honored by a granite memorial at Hockenheim but the scene of the accident is now covered by trees deep in the forest He only won two world championships because his life was taken away from him He would have won more of course he would have said Stewart Outside of Juan Manuel Fangio for me he is the greatest racing driver in the manner in which he conducted his life on the track as well as off the track Editing by Peter Rutherford LINCOLN Neb   Actor and model Hopper Penn has been released from jail after he and actress Uma Von Wittkamp were arrested on drug charges earlier this week in Nebraska Here are some facts about the couple and their arrest  A FAMOUS FAMILY Penn 24 is the son of Sean Penn the Academy Awardwinning actor filmmaker and political activist known for his roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High ''Mystic River and Milk His mother is Robin Wright an actress and director known for her work in the Netflix drama House of Cards and movies including Wonder Woman and The Princess Bride Named after Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicolson Hopper Jack Penn was born in Los Angeles but was largely raised in Ross a small exclusive town outside of San Francisco He and his mother moved back to Los Angeles around the time Wright filed for divorce in 2009 He's also the nephew of singersongwriter Michael Penn and the late actor Chris Penn His sister Dylan Frances is a model and

Standard last year that he fell in with a bad crowd during his parents' divorce which was finalized in 2010 His spiral apparently began a month after he moved to Los Angeles when he was badly injured in a skateboarding accident and had to undergo surgery for bleeding on the brain Penn has since admitted to using a variety of drugs including methamphetamine but said he sought treatment I went to rehab because I woke up in the hospital and my dad said 'Rehab Or bus bench' he said in the Evening Standard interview I was like 'I'll take the bed' A representative for the agency that represents Hopper Penn did not have any immediate comment  THE ARREST Hopper Penn was arrested Wednesday afternoon with Von Wittkamp his 26yearold girlfriend after a Nebraska State Patrol trooper stopped them on westbound Interstate 80 for allegedly failing to signal A Hamilton County sheriff's dispatcher said Penn and Von Wittkamp were released Thursday after posting 25000 bond apiece Authorities said the trooper detected drug activity in the 1992 Volvo and searched the car Inside they said they found 14 grams of marijuana four amphetamine pills and 3 grams of psilocybin a psychedelic drug commonly known as mushrooms Penn was charged with possession of a controlled substance psilocybin and possession of marijuana Von Wittkamp was charged with possession of a controlled substance amphetamine and possession of a controlled substance psilocybin Possession of a controlled substance is a felony in Nebraska punishable by up to two years in prison a year of postrelease supervision and a 10000 fine

Deputy Hamilton County Attorney Benjamin Dennis said he didn't have any information about the case beyond what was in court filings On your knees fashion slaves and crawl before me back down into our painted dungeon where I promise last weeks lingering pain will at last give way to a fair measure of pleasure Further reading implies consent The safe word is Vanjie Presumably feeling defensive about her clearly unearned mini and maxichallenge victories of last week The Vixen opened the episode with a bad offense yowling I didnt get here on accident and crediting herself with the winning performances of her teammates Monique Heart who lent The Vixen the wig that completed her Best Drag look was like many of our nations citizens tired of simply being safe and wailed that she was not winning enough Ru the dungeon master descended into the Rajneesheetoned oubliette to collar the girls into this weeks minichallenge a screen test for a commercial for his charitable chocolate bars The girls were given 20 minutes to get into fresh off the bus drag then taken in hand to a woodpaneled amateur porn set where they were thrust into a humiliation scene in which they were commanded to get on all fours bark and dance for Mama The physically stunning selfdescribed triple threat Blair St Clair managed to squeeze out a respectable time step raising her previously pitiful score to Looks Ten Dance Three They all dug right down to the souls of their bottoms and Blair the consistently hilarious Mont X Change and at last Monique were declared the tops The queens were then contracted to the maxichallenge to write and perform commercials for dating apps geared toward lonely underserved consumers These included End of Days for doomsday preppers Madam Buttrface for those looking only for a hot body and Fibstr for pathological liars  all of which I would love to see Kickstartered so as to prevent those of us swiping our way through extant apps from wasting any more time unwittingly serving these consumers Monique the Team Fibstr captain went about setting the limits of their scene and when the muscle queen Kameron Michaels auctioned off her role Mayhem Miller was asked to switch and she quietly assented Later as Mayhem was beating her face Monique asked her Can you do something strong and dominatrixlike to which she submissively replied Absolutely Her bit was muddled and when asked how she wanted her scene partner to react to her her breath was controlled and she went mute For a dominatrix she did not have a very tight grip on her gag Over on Team Madam Buttrface Yuhua Hamasaki was bossy but captain Mont humanely subdued her privately bemoaning in a confessional There is no I in team girl True but there is an e in butter so perhaps we should not cite alphabetical omissions in our adduction of others poor decisions Yuhua passiveaggressively refused to make herself as legitimately ugly as her role demanded  while her teammates gamely obscured their beauty with fake noses and rubber warts she painted herself like a Florida dinnertheater Grizabella  and when called out for it she let loose an acrid spray of defense The gorgeous Asia OHara made down to resemble Lucy the missing link proved to be the found link of the challenge She stole the show with her gnarled mugging which was benevolently whipped up by team leader Mont though she later regretted this X Change of power Focus on meeee Vanjie Despite the presence of the conflama addict The Vixen and the oratory addict Eureka the sweetfaced Blair softly guided Team End of Days through a very funny freewheeling bit  Eureka purseslapped Miz Cracker for which the latter offered retroactive consent Drag is a contact sport She really is great The Vixen was cast in the role of a street doomsayer wearing a sandwich board bearing the prophecy The End Is Near Heres hoping that this also prophesies the fate of her stint on this show She crabbed that Eurekas charismatic scene theft was somehow rigged and yet had she spent less time rolling her admittedly lovely eyes and just a few minutes making a distinctive choice and committing to it she could have chewed that sandwich board and made a meal of her character Back in the workroom Blair popped the cork on a bottle of sparkling kiki and opened up about how much she missed her mother and how close they are despite her familys strong religious beliefs The Vixens attempt to derail the story by picking a fight with Aquaria about a borrowed wig it should be mentioned that for a millennial Aquaria seems surprisingly resistant to the sharing economy was blessedly concluded by a Deus ex arachnia A spider was discovered crawling on a dress sending into a squealing fever all of the queens save for the strapping Kameron who calmly captured it and hopefully released it outdoors far from where it could hear any more fighting The heretofore underheralded Dusty Ray Bottoms snatched the open kiki bottle and poured out the heartbreaking tale of her ostracism from her religious family They were so hidebound that after sucker punching her into coming out they subjected her to an exorcism claimed that she was possessed by a gay demon and sent her to conversion therapy where she was told that in a homosexual relationship youll never find success youll never find love In the kind of moment that is the apogee of this show she wept and recounted that she then stopped the therapist packed her car and drove off to a beautiful life a hot fiance a photo confirmed this as hard fact and the revelation that she didnt have to compromise or change for someones smallminded view She then blew what was left of our minds by saying I still believe in God because I cried out and I was heard Thank you Dusty for reminding us that sometimes you have to get away from Jesus in order to truly come to Jesus Monique offered a moving coda saying Hearing everyones story is truly helping me see the truth of who they are We come here with big makeup big hair and its easy to live behind a character So its so great to see vulnerability I raise my glass of sparkling kiki to that The Vixen smelling blood in the bubbles savaged the moment by dusting the cobweb off the Aquaria fight barking The problem with Aquaria is she likes to poke the bear and run This bear will chase you Under this bears pointless pursuit Aquaria exited the workroom and the others chided The Vixen for her constant combativeness You knew I was a pit bull she retorted This demon just cannot stop vomiting soup  Dusty do you still have that exorcists number Ru ushered in the runway challenge titled simply Feathers which released a flock of toothless avian puns from the judges that largely did not fly The guest judge Nico Tortorella who is living proof that a polyamorous pansexual relationship can also bring you success and love presided along with Courtney Love who is living proof that the end of a love relationship can bring you success Standouts included Aquaria as a wounded bird pierced by two arrows presumably slung by the outrageously fortunate The Vixen and Asia OHara in a daring Tweety Bird raiment who owing to her equally brave and unique performance in the maxichallenge was deservedly named this weeks winner The bottom two Yuhua whose look called to mind an illadvised remake of the Birds featuring Carrie Bradshaw  on second thought that is a Sex and the City 3 concept that I would actually watch  and the spiritually hogtied Mayhem Miller Mayhem was flogged for her failure to take control of her scene and for her lack of discipline in her exchanges with those in power She was ordered to throw off her restraints push herself to her edge and assume the dominant role in her own Rudemptive arc My kindred sister Mayhem I strongly recommend that you fully inhabit this role as it really does help a lateblooming lady to discover articulate and demand the reaction she wants from a partner Mayhem finally found her inner mistress and dominated the lip sync to Holes Celebrity Skin By the end she was ripping madly at her feathered collar a caged bird wanting to break free The molting jolting Yuhua was cropped from the competition and sent back down to the dungeon to pack her toys Hope is the queen without feathers Our dreamgirl Mayhem is changing Look at her See you next week Vanjie"
